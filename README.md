# election-analytics-nepal-2082
A data science project analyzing Nepal’s 2082 snap election using historical election results, census demographics, voter roll data, and social media discourse.  The project builds two complementary models: a district-based proportional representation vote-share model and a constituency-level candidate-aware win probability model.

This election follows a period of political instability and mass youth protests, making it a rare case to study non-routine electoral behavior and generational shifts in voter preferences.
